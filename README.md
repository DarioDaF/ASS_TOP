## Team Orienteering Problem - Project Work for Advanced Scheduling System

The project is developed for the Advanced Scheduling System exam of Univervity of Udine. It consists in the resolutions of the Team Orientiring Problem (_TOP_) with different optimization tecniques:
+ Greedy Algorithm : solves the problem with greedy tecniques but also explores different partial solutions 
+ Parametrized Algorithm : use Simple Greedy as base and set its rating parameters weighting in differt ways the ratingPoint components 
+ Metaheuristic BackTracking : use Simple Greedy as base 
+ Metaheuristic BackTracking Focus : similar to set its parameter as Parametrized Algorithm
+ Local Search Algorithm : use EasyLocall++ libraries and algorithms to emiliorate the previous one results
+ Web based Solver : built-in web solver that print the output in the browser using the previous algorithms

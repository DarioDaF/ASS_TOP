## Team Orienteering Problem - Project Work for Advanced Scheduling System

The project is developed for the Advanced Scheduling System exam of University of Udine. It consists in the resolutions of the Team Orientiring Problem (_TOP_) with different optimization tecniques:
+ **Greedy Algorithm** : solves the problem with greedy tecniques but also explores different partial solutions 
+ **Parametrized Algorithm** : use Simple Greedy as base and sets its rating parameters weighting in differt ways the ratingPoint components 
+ **Metaheuristic BackTracking** : use Simple Greedy as base and explores the other solutions branches
+ **Metaheuristic BackTracking Focus** : similar to set its parameter as Parametrized Algorithm
+ **Local Search Algorithm** : use EasyLocall++ libraries and algorithms to emiliorate the previous one results
+ **Web based Solver** : built-in web solver that print the output in the browser using the previous algorithms

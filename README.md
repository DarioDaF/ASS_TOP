## Team Orienteering Problem - Project Work for Advanced Scheduling System

The project is developed for the Advanced Scheduling System exam of University of Udine. It consists in the resolutions of the Team Orientiring Problem (_TOP_) with different optimization tecniques:
+ **Greedy Algorithm** : solves the problem with greedy tecniques but also explores different partial solutions 
+ **Parametrized Greedy Algorithm** : use Simple Greedy as basis and searches the best set parameters that weight the rating Point components 
+ **Metaheuristic BackTracking** : use Simple Greedy as basis and explores the other solutions branches
+ **Metaheuristic BackTracking Focus** : similar to Metaheuristic BackTracking, sets its own parameter as Parametrized Greedy Algorithm
+ **Local Search Algorithm** : use EasyLocal++ libraries and algorithms to improve the previous results provided by the other algorithms
+ **Web based Solver** : built-in web solver that print the output and solve single instance in the browser using the previous algorithms
